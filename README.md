What is SnowBot-3000? 
===

SnowBot-3000 is a robot made of e-waste, mostly comprised of 2012 13" Macbook Pro bottom-cases. It utilizes the OSX/macOS Speak Synthesis Manager to convert text to speech. It features a Macbook Pro as the brain, running macOS Mojave. The codebase is pure Python 3.7, the Django Web-Framework, with a little Javascript/ajax used for asychronus server requests. It is meant to run locally, with the main index page displayed on an iPad. 

It shreds paper (snow), but this project focuses on the code (brain). It has been featured at several K-8 STEM school sites, where students had the ability to interact with it. SnowBot-3000 is your friend; beyond that, it's a passion project.

Each of the five pictures were created on an iPad Pro 12.9", and respond when touched, making SnowBot-3000 talk. The 'input' field takes the person's name and repeats it back â€” Much interactive!
